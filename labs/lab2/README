This is the README file for EECS 805, Lab #2.

The following files are provided:

    $ tree
    .
    ├── bits.c
    ├── bits.h
    ├── input.dat
    ├── output.dat
    ├── main.c
    ├── Makefile
    └── README

1) Examine the GNU Makefile script.  Notice how I have added another source 
   file.  Spend some time with this script and try to understand how this 
   works and how the different object files are linked into a single executable.
   Note that the executable is built into the 'bld' directory, and is a file 
   called 'lab'.

2) Consider the function main() in main.c.  Think about and understand what it 
   does.

3) See the function bit_reverse() in bits.c.  Modify it so that it returns a 
   bit-reversed version of the byte provided as it's input argument.
   For example if you send it the byte '0x13', it should return the byte '0xC8'.

    0x1  0x3 -> 0xC  0x8
   0001 0011 -> 1100 1000

4) Test your function.  Input data is provided in the file input.dat.  
   Concatenate that file to standard output and pipe the result to your 
   executable, like this:

   $ cat input.dat | bld/lab

   Your executable should print to the screen the bit reversal of each byte
   in the input file.  You will know you got it right when the output read
   as text shows the same as that provided in the file output.dat.  Capture 
   the output into the file myoutput.dat like so:

   $ cat input.dat | bld/lab > myoutput.dat.

   Include myoutput.dat in your file submission for this lab.

5) Consider the function bitcount() provided in the file bits.c.  Examine 
   what it does and understand it.  

6) Write a new function, bitcount2() that takes an unsigned int as input
   and returns an int as output, that counts the number of 1-bits in the 
   input byte as per Exercise 2-9 in K&R.

7) Submit your source code and output file as usual:

   $ make clean
   $ cd ..
   $ tar czf <your last name>-lab2.tar.gz lab2

End of file.
